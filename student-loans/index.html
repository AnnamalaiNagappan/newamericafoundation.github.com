<p>The clock is ticking on federal student loans. As of July 1, 2013, interest rates on Subsidized Stafford loans are scheduled to double from 3.4 to 6.8 percent. And a clear divide has emerged in the debate: fixed rates versus market-based rates. The rates are currently set arbitrarily as fixed numbers, but a market-based rate could cost students substantially less than a fixed rate in the current economy. Most analyses of the interest rate proposals have focused on Subsidized Stafford loans, the ones on which rates are set to rise. However, several of the solutions on the table also address Unsubsidized Stafford loans, which make up the majority of undergraduate loans distributed by the government and are available regardless of financial need. Lower rates on those loans could mean lower monthly payments for all borrowers next year.</p>
<p>House Republicans last month passed a bill to create variable interest rates – market-based rates that vary each year for the borrower until the loan is paid off, as opposed to most of the other proposals outlined, which set the interest rate over the entire life of the loan. Meanwhile, members of the Senate have released multiple proposals and voted on (but have not yet passed) several fixes. Below, we’ve outlined several of the most prominent proposals currently being debated:</p>

    <h2>Bipartisan Senate proposal</h2>
    <p>This proposal emerged as a last-minute solution just days before the scheduled increase in rates. Introduced by Sens. Manchin (D-WV), King (I-ME), Coburn (R-OK), Burr (R-NC), and Alexander (R-TN), it would tie rates to the 10-year Treasury plus 1.85% for all undergraduate Stafford loans. Graduate Stafford loans, however, would be set at the 10-year Treasury rate plus 3.4%. This calculator uses the undergraduate rate. The proposal would save $1 billion over 10 years. </p>

    <h2>Obama's 2014 budget proposal</h2>
    <p>President Obama released an interest rate reform proposal in his fiscal year 2014 budget that institutes a market-based rate. The rate would be based on the 10-year Treasury rate plus 0.93% for Subsidized Stafford loans or plus 2.93% for Unsubsidized Stafford loans. Combined with a proposal to expand income-based repayment, it would be deficit neutral over 10 years.</p>

    <h2>Two-year extension of 3.4% rate</h2>
    <p>Currently, rates are set at 3.4% on Subsidized Stafford loans and 6.8% on Unsubsidized Stafford loans. Though rates on Subsidized Stafford loans are scheduled to increase to 6.8% on July 1, some Democratic senators have proposed extending the 3.4% rate for another two years, without altering rates on Unsubsidized Stafford loans. The proposal would cost $9.5 billion over 10 years.</p>

    <h2>Current law assuming no changes are made</h2>
    <p>Current law says that on July 1, 2013, rates on Subsidized Stafford loans reset to 6.8%, the same as the rate on Unsubsidized Stafford loans. If Congress fails to act before the start of the 2013-14 school year, rates will remain at 6.8% for both loan types indefinitely. The proposal would have no cost over 10 years because it would not alter the budget baseline.</p>
