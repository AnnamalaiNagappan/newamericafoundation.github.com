    <h2>Bipartisan Senate proposal</h2>
    <p>This proposal emerged as a last-minute solution just days before the scheduled increase in rates. Introduced by Sens. Manchin (D-WV), King (I-ME), Coburn (R-OK), Burr (R-NC), and Alexander (R-TN), it would tie rates to the 10-year Treasury plus 1.85% for all undergraduate Stafford loans. Graduate Stafford loans, however, would be set at the 10-year Treasury rate plus 3.4%. This calculator uses the undergraduate rate. The proposal would save $1 billion over 10 years. </p>

    <h2>Obama's 2014 budget proposal</h2>
    <p>President Obama released an interest rate reform proposal in his fiscal year 2014 budget that institutes a market-based rate. The rate would be based on the 10-year Treasury rate plus 0.93% for Subsidized Stafford loans or plus 2.93% for Unsubsidized Stafford loans. Combined with a proposal to expand income-based repayment, it would be deficit neutral over 10 years.</p>

    <h2>Current law assuming no changes are made</h2>
    <p>Current law says that on July 1, 2013, rates on Subsidized Stafford loans reset to 6.8%, the same as the rate on Unsubsidized Stafford loans. If Congress fails to act before the start of the 2013-14 school year, rates will remain at 6.8% for both loan types indefinitely. The proposal would have no cost over 10 years because it would not alter the budget baseline.</p>

<small>*</small><em>Subsidized Stafford loans are available primarily to low-income students and are limited to $3,500 in the first year of school, $4,500 in the second year, and $5,500 thereafter, not to exceed $23,000 total. Unsubsidized Stafford loans are available regardless of financial need and are limited to $9,500 in the first year, $10,500 in the second, and $12,500 thereafter. Total loans may not exceed $57,500, including the $23,000 maximum in Subsidized Stafford loans. For dependent students, total loans may not exceed $31,000. NOTE: This calculator does not account for the minimum monthly payment on federal loans; a minimum amount could make accrued interest and monthly payments lower.</em></div>
