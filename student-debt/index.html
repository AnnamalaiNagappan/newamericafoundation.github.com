Rates reset annually based on short term U.S. Treasury bills, plus 3.1 percentage points, capped at 9%. Loans issued in the prior ten years carried fixed rates between 8% and 10% for the life of the loan depending on the year issued. ','1993-94': 'Congress creates the Direct Loan program to eventually replace the bank-based federal loan program. Interest rates for loans issued starting in 1998 will continue to be variable rates, but will be reset by a formula that references longer term U.S. Treasury bonds instead of short-term bills. Rates will be based on a comparable U.S. Treasury borrowing rate (i.e. 20-year), plus 1.0 percentage point.','1994-95': 'Congress lowers cap on variable rate from 9% to 8.25%.','1995-96':'','1996-97': '','1997-98': '','1998-99': 'Congress postpones interest rate change first established in 1993 until 2003 and maintains the existing formula with minor adjustments that lower rates for borrowers. The scheduled rate change was considered unworkable for private lenders. In 1993, Congress expected to phase private lenders out of the program around 1998, but lenders were still making over 60% of all federal student loans in 1998. ','1999-00': '','2000-01': '','2001-02': 'Congress, the student loan industry, and student advocates debate alternatives to the pending interest rate change that was previously set to take effect in 2003 (originally intended for 1998 but later determined to be unworkable for private lenders). Some lawmakers and student loan industry representatives propose maintaining the current reference for annually resetting variable rates instead of the pending 1993-enacted reference based on longer-term U.S. Treasury bonds. Student groups argue that the pending rate change would provide lower interest rates for borrowers than the then-current interest rate structure. ','2002-03': 'Congress cancels 1993 rate change, leaving current variable interest rate structure in place. Loans issued in 2006 and thereafter will carry fixed interest rates of 6.8%. Student groups and higher education associations champion the decision.  The 6.8% fixed interest rate -- although not scheduled to take effect until 2006 -- was calculated based on 2001 estimates of what the 1993 rate structure would produce in future years. ','2003-04': 'Loans continue to carry variable interest rates.','2004-05': 'Low-interest rate environment sets federal student loan rates at lowest level ever. ','2005-06': 'Variable rate structure continues to set rates below the pending 2006 switch to fixed 6.8% rates. Congress debates major deficit reduction bill, which includes spending reduction on student loans. House proposal cancels upcoming change to fixed interest rates and maintains existing variable rate structure, arguing that variable rates have been a better deal for borrowers. Senate proposal leaves pending 2006 switch to fixed rates in place. Both bills cut subsidies to lenders making federally-backed student loans, but the Senate bill produces larger savings because it maintains fixed interest rates for borrowers. ','2006-07': 'The 2002 interest rate change takes effect and newly issued loans carry fixed interest rates of 6.8%. House Democrats unveil 2006 campaign pledge to "cut student loan interest rates in half."','2007-08': 'Late in 2007, Congress passes bill that phases in a temporary interest rate cut over four years for a subset of student loans -- Subsidized Stafford loans issued to lower-income undergraduate students. The rate cut is meant to satisfy the House Democratic campaign platform to "cut student loan interest rates in half." The rate cut is not permanent and is phased in to limit the cost of the policy. U.S. Federal Reserve begins a series of reductions to its benchmark short-term interest rate in late 2007, which it continues through 2008. By December 2008, the benchmark interest rate is cut to 0.25%, its lowest level in history. Had student loan interest rates remained variable, rates would have reset to 4.1% in July 2008. ','2008-09': 'First phase of the 2007-enacted rate cut takes effect for Subsidized Stafford loans. Only newly issued loans qualify for the cut. Unsubsidized Stafford loans remain at 6.8%. Federal Reserve short-term interest rates remain at record lows. Had newly issued student loans remained variable rate loans, rates would have reset to 2.5% in mid-2009 and remained at this level for additional years. ','2009-10': 'Second phase of the 2007-enacted rate cut takes effect for Subsidized Stafford loans. Unsubsidized Stafford loans remain at 6.8%. ','2010-11': 'Third phase of the 2007-enacted rate cut takes effect for Subsidized Stafford loans. Congress enacts major student aid reform bill eliminating the bank-based federal student loan program. All loans are now made through the Direct Loan program. No changes are made to student loan interest rates.  ','2011-12': 'Final phase of the 2007-enacted rate cut takes effect for Subsidized Stafford loans. Congress enacts a 2011 budget bill that eliminates Subsidized Stafford loans for graduate students beginning in 2012. Graduate students remain eligible for Unsubsidized Stafford loans. Undergraduate students remain eligible for both types of loans. ','2012-13': 'The 2007-enacted rate cut for Subsidized Stafford loans expires. Previously-issued loans continue to carry the lower fixed rates; newly issued loans (both Subsidized and Unsubsidized) carry fixed rates at 6.8%. Short-term interest rates have remained at record lows since late 2008, and the Federal Reserve has pledged to maintain current rates into 2013. '};

<div id="graphCaption" style="width: 558px; margin: 0 auto"><p>Over the past 20 years, Congress has changed how interest rates for federal student loans are calculated a number of times. This year, the temporary rate cut enacted in 2007 is set to expire. In 2011-12, students who qualified for Subsidized Stafford loans will be charged 3.4 percent interest, while students who took out Unsubsidized Stafford loans (the largest federal student loan category) will be charged a fixed rate 6.8 percent. Starting in the 2012-13 school year, the rate on both Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford loans will be fixed at 6.8 percent. Roll over the points in the graph above for more information on the history of these changes.</p></div>
