        <h1>The Assets Report 2012</h1>
        <p>Savings and assets are the building blocks of economic mobility and buffers against financial emergencies. Current spending to support asset building, however, is primarily delivered through the tax code and favors higher-income households. This system leaves little support to the lower-income families who would most benefit. </p>

          <p>Savings allow families to be more resilient in the event of a financial emergency and better able to make longer-term investments that improve their economic security over time. 43% of households, however, lack the savings to live for 3 months at the federal poverty line.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Too few people are saving too little to lead a financially secure retirement. The decline in employers sponsoring retirement accounts means that many workers, especially those earning the least, have few accessible options. Less than half of workers in the second lowest income quartile are offered a 401k style retirement plan. This drops to less than 30% of workers in the lowest income quartile.</p>

          </div>
          <p>For low-income and minority families, their most valuable asset is their home. The burst of the housing bubble hit these families particularly hard since they both lost a greater share of home equity and had fewer assets to offset their decline. These losses have driven the racial wealth gap to historic levels.

          <p>A college education can play a decisive role in breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty. Low-income students, however, enroll in college at a rate 30 percentage points lower than their high-income counterparts.
