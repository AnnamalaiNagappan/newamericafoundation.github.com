Yemeni officials said they had made targets of the leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Nasser al-Wuhayshi, and his deputy, Said Ali al-Shihri, who were believed to be at the meeting with Mr. Awlaki.  The Yemeni Embassy in Washington D.C. released a statement on December 24, 2009 saying, "" ""Today, Yemeni fighter jets launched an aerial assault at 4:30 a.m., on a remote location in the province of Shabwa."" Other reports indicated that the strike was actually carried out by a U.S. cruise missile. The United States said it only provided intelligence, while Yemen denied involvement altogether. A diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks appears to indicate that it was indeed a U.S. strike, but it remains unclear what form the attack took.", ABC: <http://abcnews.go.com/WN/abcs-pierre-thomas-reports-latest-raid-yemen-killed/story?id=9419756#.T7qQJO3-DHh>  Guardian: <http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/24/yemen-strike-al-qaida>  NYT: <http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/world/middleeast/25yemen.html>   Reuters: <http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/12/24/idINIndia-44972820091224?sp=true>  Wikileaks: http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=10SANAA4&q=petraeus%20saleh ,14.64778026,46.64102249
